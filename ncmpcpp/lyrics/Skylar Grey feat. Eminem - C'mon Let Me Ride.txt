And the wheels go round... and round... and round...

If you got a sweet tooth,
You can taste my watermelons
If the swing set bores you
I can show you all my talent
I can wear a tan like other bitches can't
You can have all this, boy!
And there's only one thing that I want from you

C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
I feel it coming, coming, coming, oh
Feel it running, running, running, oh oh
C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical on your bicycle

You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike (haha)

If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid
If you get a bee-sting, I can suck out all the poison
I can make you last like other bitches can't
Have I made it clear, boy?
There's only one thing that I want from you, hey!

C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
I feel it coming, coming, coming, oh
Feel it running, running, running, oh
C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle

I'm only fucking with you
Fuck you for thinking it's true
I'm not like the sluts in this town
They make me blehh in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
'Cause you're the boy that I like
It's like I'm a sell out for you
But your bike's so shiny and new (shiny and new)

[Eminem:]
She's distracted by my reflectors, man, I can tell the chick's attracted
My wheels spoke to her, my Schwinn is a chick magnet
Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shagging's something I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicing shit
Allen Iverson of safe sex, condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards when I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy's to have you land where the kick stand is
Got this bitch gagging, they call me the broad killer
I'm the cousin of Godzilla
'Cause I spit fire and my dick is draggin'
Zig-zaggin' up the avenue, pulling these chicks in my antagonist wagon
Screamin'...

C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
I feel it coming, coming, coming, oh
Feel it running, running, running, oh
C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical on your bicycle

You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike (haha)
