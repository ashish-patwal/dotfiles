[Mike will made it:]
I'm so fresh man
Y'all scared to do it how I do it

[Hook — Miley Cyrus:]
I'm in the club high on Purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on
In the club high on Purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

[Juicy J:]
J's on my feet (you know it)
J's on my feet (you know it)
J's on my feet (you know it)
So get like me
J's on my feet (you know it)
J's on my feet (we trippin')
J's on my feet (we trippin')
So get like me

[Verse 1 — Miley Cyrus]
I be in the club (the club)
Standing on the couch (the couch)
In them Wolf Greys (what)
Like it's my house (I'm home)
Drinking out the bottle
I got no respect (ay)
Looking like a model,
Who just got a check (change)
I back it up,
Cause I don't give a fuck (I don't)
If you a lame, that's a shame
You can't hang with us (uh-uh)
I'm MC Hammer fly (fresh),
You can't touch (nope)
J's so fly
I should work at Flight Club

[Bridge – Miley Cyrus:]
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I’m naughty by nature like I’m hip-hop hooray
My hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I’m ’bout to turn up now

[Hook]

[Verse 2 — Wiz Khalifa:]
I be rockin' J's or
I be rockin' Taylors
I got lots of flavors,
My kick game is major
More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Miley, Miley, come swing the thing right by me
Got a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Juicy J:]
I stay showin' out, my kick game is a beast
I got thirty pair of J's that ain't even been released (you know it)
Flu game 12's (ho), Space Jam 11's (bitch)
On the hypebeast sick, they gon' need a paramedic (cash)
Turn up, turn up, turn up, I get trippy, I stay live (hold it)
All this purple in my cup, match them grape 5's (we're shipping)
I'm so high, I got three bitches that go bi (pussy)
I'm so fly, I'm gettin' head like a blowdryer

[Bridge]
