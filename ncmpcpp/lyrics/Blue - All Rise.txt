Stargate

Yo, yo
Your honour please
Gotta believe what I say (say)
What I will tell (tell)
Happened just the other day (day)
I must confess (confess)
'Cause I've had about enough (enough)
I need your help (help)
Got to make this here thing stop (stop)

Baby, I swear I tell the truth (uh uh)
About all the things you used to do
(Come on.)
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm tellin' you now objection overruled
Here we go
Oh, baby

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied
All rise (all rise)
All rise (all rise, all rise)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise
(I'm gonna tell it to your face.)
All rise
(I rest my case.)

You're on the stand (stand)
With your back against the wall (wall)
Nowhere to run (run)
And nobody you can call (call), oh, no
I just can't wait (wait)
Now the case is open wide (wide)
You'll try to pray (pray)
But the jury will decide (decide)

Baby, I swear I tell the truth (uh uh)
About all the things you used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
(Come on.)
I'm tellin' you now objection overruled
Oh, baby

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied
All rise (all rise)
All rise (all rise, all rise)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise
(I'm gonna tell it to your face.)
All rise
(I rest my case.)

So step back
'Cause you don't know this cat
I know deep down that
You don't want me to react
I lay low leaving all my options open
The decision of the jury has not been spoken
Step in my house
You find that your stuff has gone (gone)
But in reality to whom does the stuff belong?
I bring you into court to preach my order
And you know that you overstep the border
Uh uh

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied (ooh)
All rise (all rise)
All rise (all rise, all rise)
Three for the calls you've been making (yeah)
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise (all rise, all rise)
All rise (all rise, all rise)

One for the money and the free rides
(What you say?)
It's two for the lie that you denied
(Can't you pay?)
All rise
(What you've done?)
All rise
Three for the calls you've been making
(What you say?)
It's four for the times you've been faking
(Can't you pay?)
All rise
(What you've done?)
All rise
(Where you've gone?)

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied (oh)
All rise (oh)
All rise (uh uh uh uh)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking

I'm gonna tell it to your face
All rise
I rest my case
(uh uh uh uh)
