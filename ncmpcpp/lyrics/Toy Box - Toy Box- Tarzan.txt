Oie oie oie oie oie oie yae
Deep in the jungle
In the land of adventure, lives tarzan
Oie oie oie oie oie oie yae
I am Jane and I love to ride an elephant

Ahhhhhhhh ughh!

My name is Tarzan, I am Jungle-Man
The tree-top swinger from Jungle-land
Come, Baby come, I'll take you for a swing
Lets go hunny, I'm Tinggling

Tarzan is handsome, Tarzan Is strong
He's really cute and his hair is long
Tarzan is handsome, Tarzan is strong
So listen to the Jungle Song

Oie oie oie oie oie oie yae
I am Tarzan from Jungle, you can be my friend
Oie oie oie oie oie oie yae
I am Jane and I love to ride an elephant

Ahhhhhhhh ughh!

When you touch me, I feel funny
I feel it too when you're touching me
Come to my tree-house, to my party
Yes I'll go if you carry me

Tarzan is handsome, full of surprise
He's really cute and his hair is nice
Tarzan is handsome, Tarzan is strong
So listen to the jungle song

Oie oie oie oie oie oie yae

Oie oie oie oie oie oie yae

Hey Monkey, Get Funky

Hey Monkey, Get Funky

When I am dancing, I feel funky
Why do you keep ignoring me?

Could you could you, kiss me tenderly

Hes really cute and his hair is long
Long hair!

So listen to the jungle song
