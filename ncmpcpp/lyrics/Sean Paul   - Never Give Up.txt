[Verse 1:]
Everyday, everyday wi a work so hard
Out in the field
Every way, every way, Jah Jah bless my chad
Everything sealed
Mi work hard, suh mi haffi get my reward
Nuh bwoy cyaa call mi nuh fraud

Seh mi work hard, give thanks to father God
Give thanks fi the life weh wi have

[Chorus:]
Never give up the fight
Got to have faith
One day, one day everything gonna be alright
Never give up, never give up noo
Never give up, never give up, nuh-nuh-noo

Never give up, never give up noo
Never give up, never give up, nuh-nuh-noo

[Verse 2:]
Life nice so we got to rejoice
Everyday thought, we haffi pay these price
Don't bother fret, don't get paranoid
Caw Jah naw burden yo more than you can fight
Suh live up and nuh give up wi a live the good life
All yuh hear dem a flip up don't follow bad vibes
Lip up dem a lip up, and dem a nuh church bishop
Negative people don't follow dem noise yow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Hard work suh you know mi haffi reap by the sweat a mi brow
Suh the youths haffi eat

Suh mi nuh fear the beas

No more war in a the street
Unity that a dweet

[Chorus]

Burn germs, over and over
Over and over Jah, Jah, filled wi cup
Over and over, over and over

Game over, praise to Jehovah
We can't give it up
We can't give it up

Jah, Jah, filled wi cup
Jah, Jah, filled wi cup

We keep living up
