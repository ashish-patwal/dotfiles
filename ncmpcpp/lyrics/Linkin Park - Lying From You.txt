[Mike Shinoda:]
When I pretend, everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just (trying to bend the truth)
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm (lying my way from you)

No, no turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go)
No, no turning back now
(Let me take back my life)
(I'd rather be all alone)
No turning back now
(Anywhere on my own)
('Cause I can see)
No, no turning back now
(The very worst part of you is me)

[Mike Shinoda:]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
And now you think this person really is me
And I'm (trying to bend the truth)
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm (lying my way from you)

No, no turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go)
No, no turning back now
(Let me take back my life)
(I'd rather be all alone)
No turning back now
(Anywhere on my own)
('Cause I can see)
No, no turning back now
(The very worst part of you)
(The very worst part of you is me)

[Mike Shinoda 4x:]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

[Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington):]
(You)
No turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go)
No, no turning back now
(Let me take back my life)
(I'd rather be all alone)
No turning back now
(Anywhere on my own)
('Cause I can see)
No, no turning back now
(The very worst part of you)
(The very worst part of you is me)
