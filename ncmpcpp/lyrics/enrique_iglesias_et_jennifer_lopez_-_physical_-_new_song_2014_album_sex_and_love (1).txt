You wanna dance, you wanna move
I'm on a mission to just take you to the moon
We like to party, we're in the moonSo turn it up and let the music get you loose

We're feeling high, gimme that bass
Just get them drinks and put your hands up in the air
You know you want me so make a move
Come over here and show me what you're gonna do

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

We're gettin'physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical
We're gettin'physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical

You make me fly, I'm losing my head
Don't let me come down
Pump it up until the end
The club is bumping, blow up the roof
So never mind if we all get a little rude
Move to the right, move to the left
Now back it up you know just what you gonna get
You know you like it, I know you do
So turn it up and let the beat just get you loose

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical

You wanna dance
You wanna move
I'm on a mission to just
Take you to my room

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
