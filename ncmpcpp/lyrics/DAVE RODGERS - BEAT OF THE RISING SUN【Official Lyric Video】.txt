I'm feeling bright
Come baby come on
I say to you "it's all right"

Just you and I
We gotta fly
Oh, baby feel it
Music is power

I wanna stay all the night
I wanna hold you tonight
Oh, baby let me stay now
I'm all right, babe
Because you want it
Ready to dance

whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh...

Beat of the rising sun
Beat of the rising sun
You gotta feel the dance
It's always in your heart
Feeling the time to come
Beat of the rising sun
I wanna feel your heart
The power of the sun

I wanna fly
With you in the sky
Come take it easy, baby

With you tonight,
You're gonna shine
Oh, baby listen
Music is power

I wanna stay all the night
I wanna hold you tonight
Oh, baby let me stay now
I'm all right, babe
Because you want it
Ready to dance

whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh...

Beat of the rising sun
Beat of the rising sun
You gotta feel the dance
It's always in your heart
Feeling the time to come
Beat of the rising sun
I wanna feel your heart
The power of the sun

Beat of the rising sun
Beat of the rising sun
You gotta feel the dance
It's always in your heart
Feeling the time to come
Beat of the rising sun
I wanna feel your heart
The power of the sun

whoa oh...
whoa oh...
whoa oh...
whoa oh...
