Raising Hell

Hey hey, a flash of electricity
Thunderbolt, it's getting out of my control now

When the night is falling
And the wild heart beating
Dancing thru the heat and dark
The devil will getcha
Coming to you

Faster, go raising hell
Harder, go raising hell
We're gonna yell and storm spread this fire
Rocking, go raising hell
Rolling, go raising hell
Over to you
Faster, go raising hell
Harder, go raising hell
We're gonna yell and storm spread this fire
Rocking, go raising hell
Rolling, go raising hell
Over to you
Raising hell

Hush-hush, the flame is getting higher bound
In the rain, no way to stop it burning thru now
