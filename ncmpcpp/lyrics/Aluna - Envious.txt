Don't make me envious
You know I'm cruel when I see red
And I'm losing my head

People think I'm strong
And there ain't nothing wrong with that
Except when I get mad
Except when I get sad

And I got
No way to hold this feeling
I'll keep it to myself

And I'm just losing, losing, losing

Yeah, you got some nerve
Yeah, you know how to get to me
Yeah, you got some nerve
You know how to get to me

You know I'm cruel when I see red
You know I'm cruel when I see red
You know I'm cruel when I see red
You know I'm cruel when I see red

Don't make me envious
Get to me, you know how to get to me
Gonna make me dangerous
Get to me, get
