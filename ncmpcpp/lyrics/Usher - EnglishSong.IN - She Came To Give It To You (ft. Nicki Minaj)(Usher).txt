[Usher:]
Said it ain't what you do 'cause
(Everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back)
So baby, everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back
Said if you knew what I do, she'll be yours tonight
(So baby, everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back)
So baby, everybody closer 'cause everybody (oh-oh-oh)

Imagine she came here to get away
Well she don't want nobody crowding her space
Wouldn't that be weird? Aw yeah (Oh-oh-oh)
She was up tonight to get down
But she don't wanna be a part of the crowd
Wouldn't that be weird? Aw yeah

I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

Said it ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight
(Everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back)
And there ain't no shortcut, to doing something right
(Everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back)
If you knew what I knew, she'll be yours tonight
(Everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back)
Just look around the club 'cause you're here to have a good time

(Oh-oh-oh)
So many benefits to to being quiet, just be cool enjoy the ride
'Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldn't that be weird? Yeah
(Whoa-oh-oh)
Don't be stingy with it pass the J, let her hit it if it's headed her way
My nigga, that's weird
(You don't let her hit it, you don't let her hit it)

I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

Said it ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight
(Everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back)
And there ain't no shortcut, to doing something right
(Everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back)
If you knew what I knew, she'll be yours tonight
(Everybody closer 'cause everybody wanna get back)
Just look around the club 'cause you're here to have a good time
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, he want the flirty girl, I'm the girly girl
You know who, get the worm it's the early bird
Flow, slicker than MJ, early curl
I got to clip these niggas like Sterly Sterl
I seen him in the club, he could get the cub
I ain't talking about baseball, but go get the glove
Don't be like OJ, and forget your glove
I'm tryna get faded nigga, go and get the drugs
Five plus five, what they call that? Ten
Out in Japan, we be counting that yen
Ladies, who you trying to get it popping with? Men
No little boys, in the circle of Usher, got 'em under pressure
When your girl come through, Nicki gone crush her
And tell your man, play the back, like a spine
He only last six seconds, like a Vine

[Usher:]
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you
