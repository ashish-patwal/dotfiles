Ah, if only our voices speaking at night
Could ever reach the very edge of this world, and of time
Instead of fading into air and dust
Then what will the words, could it ever be
Farthest words from "probably"
Let's make a promise that will never fade
Let's say it together on the count of three, oh

Ah, I'm told that some part of every wish will be heard
But lately I've lost sight of the truth in those words
I can't even remember when I gave up believing
What could have been the reason?
Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop
In the place rainbow born and dies
And where the end of this life lies
I've always been insisting there was something that I've longing for

One day we'll reach to emotions unexplored unprecedented
We'll high-five love we've yet to discover and give a kiss to time
The five dimensions keep on teasing me
But I will keep on looking at you, dear
Let's make a sign for when we say "nice to meet you" again
I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name
