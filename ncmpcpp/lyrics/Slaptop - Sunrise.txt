If you move right we could dance all night
No money in the bank but the bank don't bite

Come on
If you move right we could dance all night

No money in the bank but the bank don't bite
Come on
No, I don't want you tomorrow
'Cause I want you today

When I see you, my troubles
Seem to all just melt away
We don't have a lot of money
But we have a lot of fun

We are out in the darkness
Always looking for the sun
Get ready for the weekend
Get ready for the night

We moving to the music
Till we see the morning light
Get ready for the weekend
Get ready for the night

We moving to the music
Till we see the morning light

If you move right we could dance all night
No money in the bank but the bank don't bite

Come on
If you move right we could dance all night
No money in the bank but the bank don't bite
Come on

No, I don't want you tomorrow
'Cause I want you today
When I see you, my troubles
Seem to all just melt away

We don't have a lot of money
But we have a lot of fun
We are out in the darkness
Always looking for the sun

Get ready for the weekend
Get ready for the night
We moving to the music
Till we see the morning light
Get ready for the weekend
Get ready for the night
We moving to the music
Till we see the morning light
If you move right we could dance all night
No money in the bank but the bank don't bite
Come on
If you move right we could dance all night
No money in the bank but the bank don't bite
Come on
