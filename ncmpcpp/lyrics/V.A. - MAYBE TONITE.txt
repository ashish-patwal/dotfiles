The face of an angel; pretty eyes that shine
Lie awake at night wishing you were mine
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
Whenever you come around

I get weak in the knees; and I lose my breath
Oh, I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
When you smile that smile, the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

I feel so helpless; I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, bu tthe words can't be found
Whenever you come around

I get weak in the knees; and I lose my breath
Oh, I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
When you smile that smile, the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

~~~♫♫♫ ~~~

I get weak in the knees; and I lose my breath
Oh, I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
When you smile that smile, the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

When you smile that smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
Whenever you come around
