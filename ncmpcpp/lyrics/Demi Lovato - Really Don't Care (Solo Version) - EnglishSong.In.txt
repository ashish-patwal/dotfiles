[Verse 1]
You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall
Maybe I should've known
Maybe I should've known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door (hey)
Said we were done, then met someone and rubbed it in my face
Cut to the part, she broke your heart, and then she ran away
I guess you should've known
I guess you should've known that I would talk, I would talk

[Chorus]
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you
You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you
Oh, no, not anymore
Oh, no, not anymore
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go
Now if we meet out on the street, I won't be running scared
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air
And make you understand
And make you understand
You had your chance, had your chance

[Chorus]
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care

[Bridge]
I really don't care
Mmm, you tried to break me down
Like I would hit the ground
Don't hear the hate, don't care about it
Yeah, you just don't mean enough
To really mess me up
But if you try, I'm gonna shout it
Yeah

[Chorus]
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
