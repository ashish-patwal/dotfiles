[Flo Rida:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

[Ke$ha:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
Flo Rida

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, out of control

Just like my mind where I'm going
No women, no shorties, no nothing but clothes
No stopping now, my Pirrellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on gold!

I know the storm is coming
My pockets keep telling me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies that's home
Then pop in the night 'cause it's meant to be ours

We keep a fadeaway shot
'Cause we balling this platinum Patron every hour
Look momma I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the truth with all that goody power 'cause

[Flo Rida:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
[Ke$ha:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

[Flo Rida:]
From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down
From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down

Hey! Shorty must know I'm the man
My money love her like a number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans,
My Benjamin Franklins

A couple of grands,
I got rubber bands,
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand

She's amazin',
Her fire blazin',
Hotter than Cajun,
Girl won't you move a little closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage,
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze,
That bottom is waving
At me like, "Dammit I know ya."
You want a show like a gun out a holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be ya chauffeur 'cause

[Flo Rida:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
[Ke$ha:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

[Flo Rida:]
From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down
From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down

[Bridge:]
I'm spending my money
I'm out of control
Somebody help me
She taking my bank roll
But I'm king of the club
And I'm wearing the crown
Poppin' these bottles
Touching these models
Watching they asses go down down

[Flo Rida:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
[Ke$ha:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

[Flo Rida:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
[Ke$ha:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
