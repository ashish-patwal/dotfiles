[Chris Brown:]
Baby, yeah
Mustard on the beat ho

Baby let me put your panties to the side
I'mma make you feel alright
'Cause I'mma give you what you need, yeah

Mami you remind me of something
But I don't know what it is (I don't know)
'Cause you remind me of something
Girl, you gotta show me (alright)
You remind me of something
But I don't know what it is right now (I don't know)
'Cause you remind me of something
Girl, you gotta show me

[Kid Ink:]
Uh, on the real no lie
I don't know what it is but you just my type
Everything just right
B said put it to the left
Don't listen to the hype though
Got a cup in your hand
Baby sitting but you ain't got no kids
We ain't leaving 'til there ain't no more left
Can't see no time on the Rolex
I could tell you a freak, go and show it
Looking for the after-party, where the door at?
Dough on the floor like a doormat
Baby you know where to throw that
I said

[Chris Brown:]
Mami you remind me of something
But I don't know what it is (I don't know)

'Cause you remind me of something
Girl, you gotta show me

[Chris Brown and Kid Ink:]
Baby if you know what it is
On the real, can't lie, man just my type
Hands in the air looking for a bitch right now
On the real, can't lie, man just my type

[Kid Ink:]
Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don't really care who you came with
Unless you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex try to fight you
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand
So high, ain't nowhere to land
You remind me of something missing
Missus, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the tension
If I get a minute, I'll put your bad ass in detention

[Chris Brown:]

You see all night long I've been wrong
