Let's go

Alright
For the ladies
Alright
Don't wanna take it back
Not, not the end
Holler at, Jay

[Jay Sean:]
I've been thinkin' about you
And how we used to be then
Back when
It didn't have to end
We can start again

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you
Then it's alright with me
Baby let's take this time
Let's make new memories
Let's go

Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?
Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?

Let's bring it back, bring it back
Let's bring it back, bring it back
Let's bring it back, bring it back
Let's bring it back, bring it back
Let's bring it back

How you, how you doin'? And how about we
Don't let this happen again?

Let's go

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you

[Sean Paul:]
Yo, aye, girl yo
Bring it back to the time when you and me had just begun
When I was still your number one
While it might seem far-fetched, baby girl
But it can be done
I got this feeling fire blazing and it's hot just like the sun
Know you feel it too my girl just breathe up
And the good vibes run

Girl, take a sip out the champagne
Take a little trip down my lane, my girl
While you're out every night I will feel alright
Nigga clearly this girl is a my world

Don't change up now re-arrange it girl
I'm a telling this straight into my world
How many years say ya want come kiss this
Girl, 'cause ya miss this

That's what I heard
That's what I heard
That's what I heard
Word girl
Tonight

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you
Then it's alright with me
Baby, let's take this time
Let's make new memories
Let's go

Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?
Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?

Let's bring it back, let's bring it back
