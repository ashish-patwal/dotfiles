[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wastin' my time, I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast, I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

[Chorus]
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree

[Bridge 1]
Sing!
Dap-dadada-dadpm-didap-da
Dadada-dadpm-didap-da
Dap-didili-da

[Verse 2]
I'm sittin' here, I missed the power
I'd like to go out, takin' a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder

[Bridge 2]
Isolation is not good for me
Isolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree

[Verse 3]
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder

[Chorus]
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
And I wonder, wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see, and all that I can see
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
