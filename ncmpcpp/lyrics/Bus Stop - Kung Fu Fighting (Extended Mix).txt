Ya'll ready?

Now here it is

One to make you move
Something with a funky Kung Fu groove
Something that'll make you shout
Make you play to the crowd
And make you wanna turn it out (yeah)
So homey's gather round (right round)
I'll pick you up and take you on
Go pound for pound
Coz I'm the only man'll please ya
I gotta little something that'll tease ya
So throw those hands up high (come on)
Shake your body
Move from side to side (that's right)
Coz we've just begun
Party people in the place
Yeah we're having fun
Oh yeah I'm gonna be a big star
I'm gonna lay it on and go Woo-hah
Coz when the mood gets excited (come on)
When everybody's Kung Fu Fighting

Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

(Sing it girl)
s__y Kung Fu fighter
Let me take you higher
(I got the moves baby)
Sing Kung Fu fighter
Take you higher

There's bright lights
Orinoco flow (so bright)
A Kung Fu fighter in a disco
He's out to take his chance
He knows the honey's in the house
Only go for romance (he's on the floor)
He's got a white suit on
Five past One and the night has just begun
Coz when he lays it on with style
A ladies man with a nice smile
And right before his eyes
Sees a pretty young thing looking real fine
He wants to make the score
So he takes her hand and leads her to the dancefloor
He's giving her line after line
She tells him that he looks real fine
Coz he's the man
Perfect timing
Just like when he's Kung Fu Fighting

Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

(Sing it girl)
s__y Kung Fu fighter
Let me take you higher

Kung Fu fighters everywhere
Throw those hands in the air
The time has come to turn it out
Everybody let me hear you shout

One two, do the Kung Fu
(One two, do the Kung Fu)
Say three four, on the dancefloor
(three four, on the dancefloor)
Come on one two, do the Kung Fu
(One two, do the Kung Fu)
Say three four, on the dancefloor
(three four, on the dancefloor)

One more time
Round house kick karate chop too
I'm gonna teach you all the Kung Fu
It's an eastern thing thats what I'm saying
While the retro disco track's playing
Gonna make you shout
Make you beg for more
So get your body on the dancefloor (come on girl)
So boys and girls
You know what to do
Throw those hands up and do the Kung Fu

Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing.
