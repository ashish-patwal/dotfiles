[S Dog:]
It's the Bad Boy Chiller Crew
Hold tight, S Dog on this one
Our kid Switch on production
We're not no divvies 'round here, must geet up
Hold tight, all the boys inside

[Kane:]
Drum in a big-boy Merc so I hop the curb
I see them boys in blue so drop to third
I put my foot down quick, we don't stop for shit
I make that whip pure shift like I've hit the strip
Four boys tooled up in that chorey truck
Big-boy lines of that naughty stuff
Four-wheel drive, got Clive to the right
Bright lights to the side, ride till we die
I ain't gonna lie, if it's on then I'm down for it
Boys make a lot of money from them counterfeits
That's 3 for a bag, P's in the bank
G's on the cap and keys for the Jag'
Few boys graft hard, few boys sell nosey
Four-by-fours if the boys off-roading
Fuck the police and my driving ban
I'll be hitting high speeds with Clive and Sham

I'ma pull up in a big 450
Pop it and twist it
Watch when it kicks in
Cops are assisting
Boys are resisting
Drop it and lift it
Course I'm a misfit
Red light, risk it
Bitch, I'm a charva
Big goose parka
All-black 'clava
All blacked-out, coming with the mask on
Coming for the lot
Coming for the jackpot
I'ma pull up in a big 450
Pop it and twist it
Watch when it kicks in
Cops are assisting
Boys are resisting
Drop it and lift it
Course I'm a misfit
Red light, risk it
Bitch, I'm a charva
Big goose parka
All-black 'clava
All blacked-out, coming with the mask on
Coming for the lot
Coming for the jackpot

[S Dog:]
Mo, it's S D-O to the G-G
Laying same fire with the BBCC
Big-boy tracks, get back
Big-boy bats get wrapped
Blue lights flash, peddle goes flat
Blacked-out S3 DSG's, mad
PC Plonker drives like my grandad
Dust got kicked up, car went sideways
I'm game for a graft but it's gotta go my way
Sham's not tryna get another court date
But I'm tryna put food on my family's plate
Always stay loyal on estate
Putting that work in, tryna get paid
I'm not lazy, fam, I'm active
Sham, Kane and Clive, it's a mad ting
All of the bitches dancing
Few line, cowie, then man ah get ramping

[Clive:]
Three white lines and a bank card
I be in the club, trying to kick it like Lampard
Pass me the mic. make a bad bitch skank hard
Did her bare-back in her dad's yard
Get back, big YZ wanna kick back
Police call dispatch
Three white lines and six-pack
Ten-ten birds wanna chit-chat
She'll be sucking dick for the VIP wrist band
What can I say? I'm a born sinner
155 in an all-black dinger
Cops don't want it
Smoke that chronic
Not one drug that the boys aren't shotting
Two birds in the back of the whip
They're sucking dick for a gram of the sniff
We don't tick, when I pull and I'm taking your bitch
I'm that sick, you'll be thinking that I'm taking the piss
You little div

[Gareth:]
Mask on, there's no stopping me
Watch out it's a r-r-robbery
Gloves on when I hit your Ken
Throw the keys from the side and I nick the Benz
Foot to the floor, yo, I'm a risk taker
Boys from the BD gotta get paper
Lads in the back, I'm a hit the spot
Bally on my face when I hit ya crop
Full whack, no brakes, just bust that case
Got bread, I'm paid, got ten-ten flake
I'm back with Kane, just switched that lane
Pull up to the club in that big-boy Range
Shut down sets, big fat cheques
Live life fast, that's drugs and sex
I'll be going on that big-boy dirt bike
I tell her don't call on the work line
