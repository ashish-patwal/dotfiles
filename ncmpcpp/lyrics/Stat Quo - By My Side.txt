I don't need you by my side
I don't need you, baby I've lied
'Cos I'm lonely, lonely as I can be
My one and only, changing the mood in me.

I can't see you anymore
I don't feel you as before
And I'm lonely, lonely as I can be
And it's only because you're never here with me.

Trying, oh-oh-oh I'm trying
Sighing, woh-oh-oh you've got to believe me

Because I'm lonely tonight
Something ain't right
Saving a place for you by my side
But you're still away
I don't know what to do
Because I'm lonely tonight
And all that I need is you.

I'm so lonely can't you see?
All alone all I see is me
And I'm lonely, lonely as I can be
I don't wanna fight, come on home to me.

Trying, oh-oh-oh I'm trying
Sighing, woh-oh-oh you've gotta believe me

Well I'm lonely tonight
Something ain't right
Saving a place for you by my side
I'm lonely tonight, what else is there to say?
I'm lonely tonight, nothing is going my way
'Cos I'm lonely tonight, what else is there to say?
