Rider, rider, rider of the sky
Rider, rider, rider of the sky

Rider of the sky
Rider of the sky

I was born to be a legend
Dreamin' of the seventh heaven
Pretty baby i was born to fly

Howlin' wind that blows into my hair
I just wanna reach my freedom
Up into the air

Rider of the sky
Can you feel my heart is beatin' hard now baby
Ride around of the sky
Flashin' like an arrow through, star bright

Rider of the sky

Heaven is alive between my fingers, baby
Ride around of the sky
Dartin' like a dream comes true, star bright

In my mind i feel the rhythm
You can't stop this man from dreamin'
You can't stop my flight
Into the night

Howlin' wind that blows into my hair
I just wanna reach my freedom
Up into the air

Rider of the sky
Can you feel my heart is beatin' hard now baby
Ride around of the sky
Flashin' like an arrow through, star bright

Rider of the sky
Heaven is alive between my fingers, baby
Ride around of the sky
Dartin' like a dream comes true, star bright

Howlin' wind that blows into my hair
I just wanna reach my freedom
Up into the air

Can you feel my heart is beatin' hard now baby

Flashin' like an arrow through, star bright

Rider of the sky
Heaven is alive between my fingers, baby
Ride around of the sky
Dartin' like a dream comes true, star bright
