What if we could rewind?
I think I′d do it just to feel some things twice
I think I'd do it just to be with you one more nightBut that′s all in my head

But what if I could go back?
Rewind the moments
Tell myself everything that I know right now
What would I know then?
But that's all in my head, that's all in my head

Maybe if time slowed down then I could figure out
All these thoughts in my head that keep running ′round
All these words in my mouth I can′t get 'em out
But I′m trying, oh, I'm trying

Remember playing music way too loud
Neighbors always yelling to turn it down
Meet me at your window when the Sun′s down
Remember those nights? Oh, I

Take me back to when we were teens
Spillin' all our secrets getting cold feet, bed sheets
Holdin′ on to memories that we can't keep
It's better when we were nobody, ooh, oh, oh

Body on my body, we would try so hard to keep it in
Hotels and lobbies, you would always leave me feeling bliss
Out of all the things that I know now
You′re the most that I missed out

Remember all the laughs we had
If only we could relive that
And if I′m being honest
I wish we had called it
Falling in love, like, I swear "It's no problem"

But our time seemed to change when
The trees turned to autumn
Yeah you packed all the bags you had
And I never seen you since that

Oh, take me back to when we were kids
Smoking cigarettes, pressing your lips on my lips
Dancing like nobody else was watching
Oh, like nobody was watching, oh

Oh, take me back to when we were young
Riding through the city with no purpose, top down
I wish time would stop and just stay frozen, yeah
And I′d hold onto those moments, oh

(Take me back to, oh, oh
Take me back to when)
