Trying not to think about it
Trying not to lose my mind
Trying not to lose sight
Trying not to put up a fight
Trying not to cry about it
But I wanna cry about it so bad, so bad

And I don't know what to tell you
As you said you made up your mind
And I don't know how to get on
We're walking on too many lies
And if we keep telling these lies
The pain would be harder to bare
Instead of pretending we care,
Lets just say...

Fuck it, fuck it
You don't want peace, then fuck it
You don't want love, then fuck it
Fuck it all
Fuck it, fuck it
You don't wanna live right, fuck it
You don't wanna act right, fuck it
Fuck it all.

Hard not to think about it, can't get you out my head
No time to ring it, goodbye was the best thing we said
Trying not to cry about it
But I wanna cry about it so bad, so bad

And I don't know what to tell you
As you said you made up your mind
And I don't know how to get on
We're walking on too many lies
And if we keep telling these lies
The pain would be harder to bare
Instead of pretending we care,
Lets just say...

Fuck it, fuck it
You don't want peace, then fuck it
You don't want love, then fuck it
Fuck it all
Fuck it, fuck it
You don't wanna live right, fuck it
You don't wanna act right, fuck it
Fuck it all.

Fuck it all!
Fuck it all!

And I don't know what to tell you
As you said you made up your mind
And I don't know how to get on
We're walking on too many lies
And if we keep telling these lies
The pain would be harder to bare
Instead of pretending we care,
Lets just say...

Fuck it, fuck it
You don't want peace, then fuck it
You don't want love, then fuck it
Fuck it all
Fuck it, fuck it
You don't wanna live right, fuck it
You don't wanna act right, fuck it
Fuck it all.

Fuck it all!
Fuck it all!
