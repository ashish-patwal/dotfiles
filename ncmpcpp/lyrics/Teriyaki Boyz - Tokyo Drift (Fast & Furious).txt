[Chorus]
I wonder if you know
How they live in Toyko
If you see me then you mean it
Then you know you have to go
Fast and furious (Tick, Tick, Tick)
Fast and furious (Tick, Tick, Tick)
[Repeat]

[j__anese verse]

I see many many diamonds danglin
Back for the money keep stranglin
Hate me, fry me, bake me, try me
All the above cuz you can't get in
I don't want to put up with them
Because we put a fresh ....
Make you, shake you, .... (Thank you!)
Haters ..................

[j__anese verse]

[Chorus]

[j__anese verse]

Should see me in the parking lot
7-11 is the spot
Mice with wings and shiny things
And lions, tigers, bears, Oh my ride
We're furious and fast
Super sonic like JJ Phat
An' we rock cuz the wheels are fly
Can't be doubt with a bastball bat

[j__anese verse]

[Chorus]

[j__anese verse]

It's gotta be the shoes
Gotta be the furs
That's why ladies choose me
All up in the news
Cuz we so cute
That's why we so huge
[j__anese]
Not a Chinaman cuz I ain't from China man
I am j__an man

[Girls Talking]
You see him come and go out of the black Benz SLR.
I wonder where he get's that kind of money?
Don't worry about it.
Lets Go

[Chorus]
