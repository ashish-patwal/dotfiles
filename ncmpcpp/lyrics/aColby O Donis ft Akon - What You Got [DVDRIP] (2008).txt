[Akon:]
Konvict (Konvict)
Oh [8x]

[Colby:]
I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off your stone
And noticed that,
That pinky ring is bright enough baby
I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin'
And sizing you up baby

And I like the way you take advantage of every man you love
I see, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if you come and play with us, just don't talk too much
I see you, you're so cute, you don't have to say a word

[Hook:]
Yeah those guys wanna come treat you right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always taking on the spotlight
Always in the club looking hot
Girl you know that you need to stop

[Chorus:]
Always talking about what you got
Always talking about what you got
Always talking about what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talking about what you got
Always talking about what you got
Always talking about what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop

Girl I can tell you want somethin' to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist girl, and I can't lie and I can tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized

And I like the way you take advantage of every man you love
I see, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if you come and play with us, just don't talk too much
I see (I see it), so you don't have to say a word

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Akon:]
Can't keep my eyes away from you girl
When you get on the floor
And do what you do
And everybody want to come back to that body
That kind of remind myself I like you
Be sure that type drive a man crazy and snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back
He'll end up callin' you baby
And they never really know what to do
Once you expose that thing you do
You had him crawlin' on his hands and knees
And you find a way to get him out of that cheese
And why you thinkin' you're the only dude
She off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' everybody know she got you
But now you feel like a fool

[Hook]

[Chorus]
