[Verse 1]
Help, please this is an emergency
This man suffered burns in the third degree
I think that he might need surgery
That'll teach him to step to the rap Hercules
Acting like he never heard of me, now for eternity
He'll never say another word to me
I value courtesy over currency
But I need them both urgently, certainly
Flipping so many birds, I need a bird machine
All these haters claiming I disturb the peace
Another white boy? What an absurdity!
But your negative comments are no concern to me
Cuz your bitch screaming out "damn you're hurting me!"
But then she's saying "oh baby you're the world to me"
I've come a long way from a nerd to G
Everyone's a rapper so I'll be the first emcee
