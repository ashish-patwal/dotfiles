Sixteen years - without even a place to call my own,
But I'll dry my tears looking for a place to rest my bones.
All these years - but never changed the one that I have known.
And despite my fears - I'm sure that I can make it on my own.

Party drugs and limousines
Oh, mama, this is killing me.
I'm half the man I used to be.
Tequila, lust and gambling
Oh, mama, I need rescuing.
What sixteen years has done to me.

Sixteen years - burning every bridge that I have known.
Without you here, the world has gotten colder on my own.

Party drugs and limousines
Oh, mama, this is killing me.
I'm half the man I used to be.
Tequila, lust and gambling
Oh, mama, I need rescuing.
What sixteen years has done to me.

[2x]
There's nothing like it - I'm going away.
There's nothing like the feeling -
Of being alone on a New York street,
Gives everything some meaning.
There's nothing like being torn apart -
From a love you've known right from the start.
There's nothing like this feeling.

Party drugs and limousines
Oh, mama, this is killing me.
I'm half the man I used to be.
Tequila, lust and gambling
Oh, mama, I need rescuing.
What sixteen years has done to me.

It's what sixteen years has done to me.
It's what sixteen years has done to me.
