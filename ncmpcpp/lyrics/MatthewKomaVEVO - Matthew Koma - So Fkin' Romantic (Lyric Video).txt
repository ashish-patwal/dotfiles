[Chorus]
I'm so fuckin' romantic
That you can't even handle it
I'm California magic
And I can keep your candle lit
We could sail the oceans
And swim in the Atlantic
You could say I'm hopeless
But I'm so fuckin' romantic

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so fuckin' romantic
I'm so fuckin' romantic
I'm so fuckin' romantic

[Verse 1]
Flash, my camera going off
I'll be your paparazzi all night long
Splash, bubbles for days
Spoil you rotten, chocolate and flames

[Chorus]
We could sail the oceans
Swim in the Atlantic
You could say I'm hopeless
But I'm so fuckin' romantic
I'm so fuckin' romantic
That you can't even handle it
I'm California magic
And I can keep your candle lit
We could sail the oceans
And swim in the Atlantic
You could say I'm hopeless
But I'm so fuckin' romantic

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so fuckin' romantic
I'm so fuckin' romantic

[Verse 2]
Cash raining on us
Designer clouds and beds white as doves
Class, I'll treat you like the queen
My Cleopatra, Madonna baby

[Chorus]
We could sail the oceans
Swim in the Atlantic
You could say I'm hopeless
But I'm so fuckin' romantic
I'm so fuckin' romantic
I'm so fuckin' romantic
That you can't even handle it
I'm California magic
And I can keep your candle lit
We could sail the oceans
And swim in the Atlantic
You could say I'm hopeless
But I'm so fuckin' romantic

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so fuckin' romantic
I'm so fuckin' romantic
I'm so fuckin' romantic
