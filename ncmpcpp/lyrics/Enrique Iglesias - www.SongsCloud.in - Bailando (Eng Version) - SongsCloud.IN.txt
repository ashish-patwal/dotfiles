[Enrique:]
You look at me and, girl, you take me to another place
(because me need it, baby girl)
Got me feeling like I'm flying, like I'm out of space
(heart beat)
Something 'bout your body says, "Come and take me."
(because me need it, baby girl)
Got me begging, got me hoping that the night don't stop
(rock that body 'cause we don't stop party)

[Gente De Zona:]
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Tu cuerpo y el mío
Llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
(Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro
Me está enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

[Enrique:]
Girl, I like the way you move
Come and show me what to do
You can tell me that you want me
Girl, you got nothing to lose
I can't wait no more (ya no puedo más)
I can't wait no more (ya no puedo más)

[Sean Paul:]

She a-go love how me a set it
'Cause you no say me no pet it
Me a-tell her no for fret it
Any time when me get it
It's gonna be alright.
We taking it full flight,
We doing this all night,
Baby girl.

[Enrique:]
I wanna be contigo
And live contigo,
And dance contigo
Para have contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)

I wanna be contigo

And live contigo,
And dance contigo
Para have contigo
Una noche loca
(with you, girl)
Con tremenda loca

[Sean Paul:]
Oh, oh, oh, come, baby girl?
Oh, oh, oh, stay with me, girl!
Oh, oh, oh, play with me, girl!
Oh, oh, oh, come, baby girl?

[Enrique:]
I look at you and it feels like paradise
(estoy en otra dimencion)
You got me spinning, got me crazy, got me hypnotized
(tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón)
(heart beat)
I need your love, I need you closer
(because me need it, baby girl)
Keep me begging, keep me hoping that the night don't stop
(rock that body 'cause we don't stop party)

[Gente De Zona:]

Me va saturando
(Bailando)

Baby girl, you are the bomb bomb

The way you move, girl, let me heart beat want stop
Tik a tik a tok, never gonna stop, girl
Let my heart burn
When you twist it and turn

Energy you give me, girl, a-you run the world
Sexy body shape and you're full of body curves
Let me body tense to a rise up in there
Long time you're looking you fi listen my word

Oh, oh, oh, come, baby girl?
Oh, oh, oh, stay with me, girl!
Oh, oh, oh, play with me, girl!
Oh, oh, oh, come, baby girl?
