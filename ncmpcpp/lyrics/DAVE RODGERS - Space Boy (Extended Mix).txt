Every night you light me with your gasoline
Every time I feel delight when you recall my name
So you can be my shining star tonight
I′m not alone with all your love
Fly across the sky, you will be mine
I can feel your dream with you babe

I'm gonna get you
Like a space boy
Oh-oh-oh
I′m ready babe

I'm gonna get you
I'm your space boy
Dive into your heart babe

I′m gonna get you
Like a space boy
Oh-oh-oh
I need you babe

I′m gonna get you
I'm a space boy
Take a chance with me baby

Every night you drive me crazy like you know
Every day I scream so loud you′ll always be my queen

So you can be my shining star tonight
I'm not alone with all your love
Fly across the sky, you will be mine
I can feel your dream with you babe

I′m gonna get you
Like a space boy
Oh-oh-oh
I'm ready babe

I′m gonna get you
I'm your space boy
Dive into your heart babe

I'm gonna get you
Like a space boy
Oh-oh-oh
I need you babe

I′m gonna get you
I′m a space boy
Take a chance with me baby

Every night you light me with your gasoline
Every time I feel delight when you recall my name

So you can be my shining star tonight
I'm not alone with all your love
Fly across the sky, you will be mine
I can feel your dream with you babe

I′m gonna get you
Like a space boy
Oh-oh-oh
I'm ready babe

I′m gonna get you
I'm your space boy
Dive into your heart babe

I′m gonna get you
Like a space boy
Oh-oh-oh
